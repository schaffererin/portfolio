Hi! My name is Erin. 

I grew up in Iowa, and ever since I was a little girl, I'd wanted to be a teacher like my mom. Yes, of course, I toyed with the idea of being a veterinarian, a marine biologist, a detective, but underneath it all, I knew the truth: I'd be a teacher.

When I got to Iowa State University, I decided to pursue English and Spanish education. Throughout my studies, I realized that the education field wasn't what I dreamt it to be. I was a bit of a wreck. _What did I want to do with my life now that I've found that the thing I thought I wanted wasn't right for me?_

I sat down with myself to determine my goals and interests, which led me to enroll in a technical writing course. That course helped me realize that technical writing was what I wanted to do; it forced me to think and write in ways that I never had before, and the challenge excited me (and to this day, it still excites me).

I finished my studies at Iowa State in English and Spanish and moved out to Seattle, enrolling in [University of Washington's Professional Technical Writing certification program](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/professional-technical-writing). I'm now a Content Developer 2 for [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/what-is-aks) at Microsoft.

Below, I've shared links to just some of the projects I've worked on: AKS content, blog pieces, and my initial portfolio projects with the inspiration behind them.

## AKS

## Azure for Students

After finding my passion for technical writing, I began teaching myself the basics of Python and decided to enroll in a Python programming course at Iowa State University. I didn't have the fastest computer, and that became very clear when running my scripts. After my course ended, I learned that most major cloud providers give students free credits to apply toward their services. Out of curiosity, I went through the process and realized it would've been an easy way to run my scripts faster. I documented my steps, hoping to help college students in similar situations take advantage of this free resource.

## Yelp proposal

As a member of the Yelp Elite Squad, it's safe to say I really enjoy Yelp. The pandemic changed what I prioritized when browsing reviews of businesses and restaurants. There was no major reviews service with granular metrics that focus on COVID-19 safety. By adding a new user-given COVID-19 rating feature to every Yelp page, Yelp can allow their users to continue leaving comprehensive and accurate reviews, so we all can safely support local businesses and restaurants.

## Cree and Dams research narrative

This research narrative details the unjust treatment of the Cree Nation by the Canadian government, Hydro-Quebec, and the James Bay Energy Corporation.

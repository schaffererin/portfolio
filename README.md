# Erin Schaffer's Portfolio

Hi! My name is Erin. 

I grew up in Iowa, and all my life, I wanted to be a teacher like my mom. When I got to Iowa State University, I decided to pursue English and Spanish education. Throughout my studies, I realized that the education field wasn't what I dreamt it to be, so I sat down with myself to determine my goals and interests, which led me to enroll in a technical writing course. That course helped me realize that technical writing was what I wanted to do; it forced me to write in a way that I never had before, and that challenge excited me (and to this day, it still excites me).

I finished my studies at Iowa State in English and Spanish and moved out to Seattle for the [University of Washington's Professional Technical Writing certification program](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/professional-technical-writing). I'm now a vendor on the Azure Resource Manager content development team at Microsoft.

Below I've shared links to some of my favorite blog articles I've worked on, as well as the inspiration behind my portfolio projects.

## Azure for Students

After finding my passion for technical writing, I began teaching myself the basics of Python and decided to enroll in a Python programming course at Iowa State University. As your typical college student, I did not have the fastest computer, and that became very clear when running my scripts. After my course ended, I learned that most major cloud providers give students free credits to apply towards their services. Out of curiosity, I went through the process and realized it would have been an easy way to run my scripts faster. I documented my steps, hoping to help college students in similar situations take advantage of this free resource.

## Yelp Proposal

As a member of the Yelp Elite Squad, it is safe to say I really enjoy Yelp. The pandemic has changed what I prioritize when browsing reviews of businesses and restaurants. There is currently no major reviews service with granular metrics that focus on COVID-19 safety. By adding a new user-given COVID-19 rating feature to every Yelp page, Yelp can allow their users to continue leaving comprehensive and accurate reviews, so users can safely support local businesses and restaurants.

## Booking a Ferry Trip with Washington State Ferries

In the Professional Technical Writing program at the University of Washington, we were assigned a how-to guide for booking a ferry trip with Washington State Ferries. In our assignment description, we were instructed to create clear documentation for booking a trip that improved upon the existing documentation in place on the official website.

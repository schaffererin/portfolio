# Deploying your Python script to the cloud with Azure for Students

**Meet Megan.**

<img src="images/megandoc.png" width="200">

Megan is a junior in college. She's taking a Python course and working on her final project. Like many college students, Megan couldn't afford a powerful laptop. When she tried to run her final project on her computer, she realized that it would take weeks for the program to finish running. She didn't have weeks to wait. She needed a solution. But what?

**Megan, meet Azure for Students.**

With a free Azure for Students account, you can deploy your Python scripts to a powerful virtual machine and cut your run-time significantly. Azure for Students gives students $100 in free credits every year.

You're charged by the minute, so it's important to use your virtual machine only when you need it, and turn it off immediately when you're done. Whatever remaining credits you have can then be used within a year of your sign-up date.

Are you in a situation similar to Meganâ€™s? Azure for Students is for you, too. Let me show you how to get started!

## Download Remote Desktop Protocol Client

Before you start, download [Remote Desktop Protocol Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients) (RDP client) and follow the applicable link for your computer. RDP client allows you to control other computers remotely, which is how you will use your virtual machine.
